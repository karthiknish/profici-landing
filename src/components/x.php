        <h2>Introducing Our New Customer Rewards Scheme</h2>
        <p>At JoeTec, we're excited to introduce our brand-new Customer Rewards Scheme - a loyalty program designed to give you even more value for your business. This concept is simple: the more you spend with us, the bigger the discount you'll enjoy on your future projects. It's our way of saying thank you for choosing JoeTec, and we want to give you every reason to keep coming back.</p>
        <p>Whether you're working on one-off projects or building a long-term relationship with us, our tiered rewards system ensures that you're always getting the best value for your money. From Sound Insulation Testing to SAP Calculations, you'll save more with every project.</p>

    <section class="how-it-works">
        <h2>How Does the JoeTec Reward Scheme Work?</h2>
        <p>Our rewards scheme is straightforward and easy to follow. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Spend with Us:</strong> Each time you complete a project with JoeTec, the total (excluding VAT) adds to your cumulative spend.</li>
            <li><strong>Unlock Discounts:</strong> Once you reach a certain spending threshold, you'll unlock a discount that's automatically applied to all future projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Bigger Projects, Bigger Discounts:</strong> As your spending increases, so does your discount - with savings of up to 15% on all future projects.</li>
        </ol>
